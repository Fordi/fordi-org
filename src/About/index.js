            <h2>a brief history</h2>

            <p>
                Bryan's first experience with programming was in second grade. Dad had 
                just bought their first computer, and Bryan spend months poring over 
                the GW Basic syntax manual, testing commands, breaking things, and 
                wondering what a "Syntax" was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through middle and high schools, Bryan taught himself Turbo Pascal, 
                rudimentary game programming, Assembly Language, C, and ultimately HTML 
                and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, he has freelanced for a number of clients in the 
                Philadelphia area, including The Wharton School, Abacus Studios, Sevens 
                and Sixes, and I-SITE. He then spent two years at TrueAction, Inc., 
                building the UI for demanding eCommerce clients like Toys R Us. At RSI 
                Content Solutions, he creating the UI and much of the back-end for 
                RSuite CMS version 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                At present, he's a contractor for Comcast, helping to transition the 
                large MyAccount customer portal from a monolithic Angular 1.4 app into 
                a suite of small React apps, maintaining the existing site, updating 
                accessibility, and working with a number of large API teams to create 
                new user features.
            </p>

            <h2>a particular set of skills</h2>

            <p>
                Webdev has become a complex space of frameworks, libraries, languages, 
                language flavors, linters, compilers, services, and continuous 
                integrators.  No more can you afford to waste time on a simple HTML and 
                CSS jockey - you need someone who can navigate the world of node, Ruby, 
                Java and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bryan has taken on much of what's popular in the professional web 
                development world, and is competent to hit the ground running on
                almost any project environment.  He's opinionated when it matters,
                but he'll happily adapt to whatever practices exist in the shop.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS?  <em>S</em>CSS? LESS?  He's mastered it.  React?  Angular?  Ember?
                Bryan can work on it.  Rails?  Spring?  Doesn't matter; he's done it 
                before.
            </p>
            
            <h2>future targets</h2>

            <p>
                Bryan's ambitions are relatively simple. He would like to work on innovative software, 
                and make it a pleasure for others to work on - "others" being a term that includes 
                himself in six months: maintenance can be as challenging as development, and good 
                test-driven development, coupled with good documentation, can ease that pain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Past that, he would like to have a relationship with a company with clear goals, 
                excellent management, and a developement team that is open to new ideas and 
                technologies.
            </p>
